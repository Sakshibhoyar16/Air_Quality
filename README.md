# Air Quality Analysis

This project analyzes air quality data using Python to extract insights from environmental pollutant levels. It utilizes a dataset containing air quality metrics such as PM2.5, PM10, and other gases. The notebook performs data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset (`air quality data.csv`) contains daily measurements of various air pollutants. Key features include:

- Date
- PM2.5
- PM10
- NO2
- SO2
- CO
- O3

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (if ML is applied)

## 📊 Features of the Project

- Data loading and cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Time-series visualization of pollutants
- Trend detection and seasonal variations
- Optional: Predictive modeling for pollution levels
